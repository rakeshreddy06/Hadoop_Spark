Problems faced: I completed the setup and all Hadoop and spark configurations but after 3 days i was mot  able to access my node for 2 days i tried all at last I hard rebooted the instance and started my work again


Setup 

Hadoop Environment settings:

Ensure you r root
Used Java 8 for compilation of libraries and hadoop3.2.1 for Hadoop Sort
I created Jar file and SortDriver and just needed to run by using this cmd in the hdfs environment 
hadoop jar HadoopSort.jar  SortDriver ***/input/path***  ****/output/path******
Please specify your gen sort input and output path for the output
It will map and reduce jobs and will give output like this.
Please delete the output path after every time using the cmd because in essence there will be a directory or else use a different directory for different output
Please find the screenshots of my work for any doubt 


Proof of execution the environment


Spark Environment setup

Ensure you r root 
sudo apt install maven
Spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3 this is my spark version ensure to use it 
In the project do mvn package
This program sorts by first 10bytes taken as key and used 24 cores and 96GB memory
Use the below command to generate  sorted data
spark-submit   --class SortGensortData   --master local[24]   --executor-memory 96G   my-spark-project/target/spark-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar   input output
Ensure to specify to the jar generated by the mvn package
Where in the input field pls mention the file to be sorted and leave output as it is
Please find screenshots of my work in the report for any doubt
After running the program you find parts of spark use this command for final output
 cat part-* > outputfile.txt


Proof of execution


Note :: valsort output cant able to verify inside hdfs environment so just pasted screenshot in the report head and tail as successful sort executions and logs generate after program execution
